# Overview

This project is a Java implementation of the **UML state machine** specification as
described in [UML superstructure 2.4.1](http://fabienrenaud.github.io/lympid/lympid-core/docs/UML superstructure 2.4.1.pdf).
It is implemented with **Java 8** and packaged as a valid **OSGi bundle**.

The implementation supports nearly every single feature of behavioral state machines:

  * states: simple, composite, orthogonal and submachine
  * pseudo states: initial, entry point, exit point, junction, choice, join, fork, shallow history, deep history and terminate
  * transitions: external, internal and local
  * transition events, transition guards, transition effects, the two latter have easy and typed access to the event and context data
  * state entry and state exit behaviors, with easy and typed access to context data
  * asynchronous state activity behaviors, with easy and typed access to context data
  * completion events (transition with no triggers/events)
  * time events
  * custom events

and comes with an easy-to-use builder API that takes away from the developer the inherent complexity of UML state machines.

Other features include, but not only:

  * build once, use many times: `StateMachine` instances do not contain any execution data and are not changed throughout the execution of a state machine. Therefore, they can be reused as many times as necessary.
  * various state machine executors: synchronous/synchronized executor, lock executor, queued executor, sharded executor
  * state machine listeners: to listen to everything that happens in the state machine
  * prioritized transitions: when more than one transition is enabled for a (pseudo) state, only one will be fired. You can define which it will be.
  * configurable state machine executor: auto start, thread pool for asynchronous events and activities, ...

It is heavily **tested with more than 120 state machines and more than 700 unit tests**. Code and branch coverage is above 90%.

UML state machine is not an easy topic for the non-initiated.

## Tutorial 1: A simple state machine

Let's implement the following state machine which describe an on/off switch:

![tutorial1](http://fabienrenaud.github.io/lympid/lympid-core/docs/Tutorial1/diagram.png)

First, create your state machine builder:

```java
StateMachineBuilder builder = new StateMachineBuilder("OnOff");
```

And build the initial vertex with all its outgoing transitions:

```java
builder                  // the state machine builder
  .region()              // a (pseudo) state always belong to a region!
    .initial()           // adds an initial pseudo state in this region
      .transition("t0")  // adds a transition named "t0" to the initial pseudo state
        .target("off");  // defines the target of the initial transition
```

Now, repeat the operation for the next (pseudo) state. Let's do the "off" state:

```java
builder
  .region()              // this is the same region as before, same instance.
    .state("off")        // creates a simple state named "off"
      .transition("t1")  // adds an external transition named "t1" to the state "off"
        .on("ON")        // t1 can only be fired when the state machine receives the event "ON"
        .target("on")    // t1 targets the "on" vertex
      .transition("t3")  // adds an external transition named "t3" to the state "off"
        .on("KILL")      // t3 can only be fired when the state machine receives the event "KILL"
        .target("end");  // t3 targets the "end" vertex
```

And again with the vertex "on":

```java
builder
  .region()
    .state("on")
      .transition("t2")
        .on("OFF")
        .target("off");
```

And the final state:

```java
builder
  .region()
    .finalState("end");
```

Now, get a `StateMachine` instance, choose which `StateMachineExecutor` you want to use and start it:

```java
StateMachine machine = builder.newInstance(); // builds and validates the state machine; the result is cached

StateMachineExecutor fsm = new SyncStateMachineExecutor();
fsm.setStateMachine(machine);
fsm.go();
```

When `go` is invoked, the state machine auto starts by default and the initial transition is fired.
Therefore, the state machine is now on state "off", waiting for either event "ON" or event "KILL".
You can see so by takign a snapshot of the state machine and looking at its active state configuration:

```java
System.out.println(fsm.snapshot().activateStates()); // outputs off
```

Then, use the `take` method to feed the state machine with events. For instance:

```java
fsm.take(new StringEvent("ON"));
System.out.println(fsm.snapshot().activateStates()); // outputs on

fsm.take(new StringEvent("OFF"));
System.out.println(fsm.snapshot().activateStates()); // outputs off

fsm.take(new StringEvent("KILL"));
System.out.println(fsm.snapshot().activateStates()); // outputs end
```
And that's it!
